GitLit is a cocktail search application that uses the CocktailDB API to give the user thousands of choices based on alcohol types and ingredients. After the drink is chosen the user can add the drink option to the favorites feature. The application was made using React components and React Hooks to pass all the data through. The favorites is set up using express and MongoDB as a database on MongoDB Atlas while depoloyed to Heroku. The user authentication is set up using Auth0 and connects to the favorites on the backend using React, Node, MongoDB, and Express. The API is pulled using get and post in our controllers folder. Test Automation was done using Jest, Enzyme, and the react-testing-library integrated with code climate and circle-ci to Heroku with all tests passed. React-bootstrap was used as a CSS library. 


The following code used useState and useEffect Hooks to create a template for cocktail instructions, name, and ingredients to render in the search component. 

```js
   import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import API from "../utils/api";
import Search from "../components/Search/Search";
import DrinkDetails from "../components/DrinkDetails/DrinkDetails";

const DrinkSearch = () => {
  //  Sets state for drink and ingredient searches
  const [data, setdata] = useState([]);
  const [cocktailSearch, setCocktailSearch] = useState("");
  const [deetsSearch, setDeetsSearch] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    API.searchDrinks().then((results) => {
      setdata(results.data);
    });
  }, []);

  const handleInputChange = (event) => {
    // Destructure the name and value properties off of event.target
    // Update the appropriate state
    const { value } = event.target;
    setCocktailSearch(value);
  };
  // API call to find all cocktails matching input
  const searchCocktail = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    API.searchDrinks(cocktailSearch).then((results) => {
      setdata(results.data);
    });
  };
  // API call to get selected drinks details
  const drinkDeets = (id) => {
    API.drinkInfo(id).then((results) => {
      setDeetsSearch(results.data);
    });
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <Search
        data={data}
        cocktailSearch={cocktailSearch}
        handleInputChange={handleInputChange}
        searchCocktail={searchCocktail}
        drinkDeets={drinkDeets}
      />
      <DrinkDetails details={deetsSearch} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default DrinkSearch;

```

Work Day Scheduler is a website I created to monitor the 9 to 5 work day by planning each hour throughout
              the day. This scheduler is a responsive approach to store your events throughout the day and create
              new events on the following days.
This uses pretty simple JavaScript concepts to create a dynamic user friendly application to store your schedule. Since this was done on mainly JavaScript and jQuery using no backend frameworks the data is stored in the local storage. Moment.js is used to add the value of time to the code and a function to change the color of the time slot was then implemented to have current time period as the color red, all future time periods as green, and all past time periods as grey. The hours rendered are also 9am to 5pm to match a workplace enviornment. 

The following is the code used to define the hours using moment.js while simultaneosly changing the textarea color depending on the time of day.



```js
        function init() {
        
          var getCurrentHour = moment().hour();
          var hours = ["9 AM", "10 AM", "11 AM", "12 PM", "1 PM", "2 PM", "3 PM", "4 PM", "5 PM"]
          var militaryTime = [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
          for (var i = 0; i < hours.length; i++) {
            var row = $("<div class = 'row'>")
            var col1 = $("<div class = 'col-sm-2 text-right'>")
            col1.attr("bgcolor", "#90eebf")

            col1.append(hours[i])
            var col2 = $("<div class = 'col-sm-8'>")
            var textarea = $("<textarea>")

            textarea.attr("id", "eventStored" + i)

            if (getCurrentHour === militaryTime[i]) {
              textarea.attr("class", "auto-save form-control bg-danger text-white ")
            }
            else if (getCurrentHour < militaryTime[i]) {
              textarea.attr("class", "auto-save form-control bg-success text-white ")

            }
            else {
              textarea.attr("class", "auto-save form-control bg-secondary text-white ")
            }


            col2.append(textarea)
            var col3 = $("<div class = 'col-sm-2'>")
            var button = $("<button>")

            button.attr("class", "saveBtn")
            button.text("Save")
            button.on("click", save)
            col3.append(button)
            row.append(col1, col2, col3)

            $("#dailyPlanner").append(row)
          }
          getData()
        }
        init();
```
